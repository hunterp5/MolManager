# Contributing to MolManager

This document is the versioned source of project coding standards for humans and CI.
Cursor-specific copies live under [`.cursor/rules/`](../.cursor/rules/) (tracked in git).

## Coding standards

### Copyright headers

- Every **new** first-party source file must include the standard MolManager GPL copyright header.
- Keep a shebang as line 1 when present; put the header immediately below it.
- Do **not** add the header to vendored/third-party assets (e.g. `molmanager/ui/static/`).
- Full header text: [`.cursor/rules/copyright-headers.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/copyright-headers.mdc).
- Check: `python scripts/check_gpl_headers.py`
- Bulk insert: `python scripts/add_gpl_headers.py`

### Python style and formatting

- Follow **PEP 8** and keep code clean and maintainable.
- Format and lint Python with **Ruff** (`pyproject.toml` `[tool.ruff]`).
- Prefer **type hints** for public functions and non-trivial internal helpers.
- Avoid redundant comments; only comment on non-obvious intent or trade-offs.

```bash
python -m ruff check molmanager tests scripts
python -m ruff format molmanager tests scripts   # optional local format
```

CI currently gates on Ruff correctness / undefined-name rules plus unused imports and locals
(`E9`, `F63`, `F7`, `F82`, `F401`, `F841`).

### Naming conventions

- **snake_case** for variables and functions.
- **PascalCase** for classes.
- Descriptive names; avoid single-letter names except conventional loop indices.

### Quality and correctness

- Fix problems at the **cause**, not the symptom.
- Keep the UI responsive by offloading heavy work off the GUI thread (`ProcessQueueManager`, `QThreadPool`, workers).
- Keep changes cohesive; avoid drive-by refactors unless required.
- New tools: dialog → worker (if heavy) → menu wiring → tests. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Exception handling

- Prefer narrow `except` clauses and re-raise unexpected failures.
- Do not use bare `except Exception: pass` for non-fatal paths without logging.
- Use `molmanager.exception_policy.log_swallowed_exception` when intentionally swallowing an error
  (best-effort UI/progress/shutdown helpers).
- Large sketcher/RDKit call sites still contain many defensive catches; convert them as those
  modules are touched.
- File logging is on by default (`molmanager/app_logging.py`); override with `MOLMANAGER_LOG_DIR`,
  disable with `MOLMANAGER_LOG_TO_FILE=0`. Uncaught exceptions show a crash dialog with the log path.

### Git commits

- Prefer concise commit messages focused on **why**.
- **Never** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor`, `cursoragent@cursor.com`, or similar agent attribution to commits or PRs.

## Sketcher / chemistry docs

Before changing structure drawing or stereo behavior, read:

- [IUPAC_DRAWING.md](IUPAC_DRAWING.md) and [`.cursor/rules/iupac-drawing-sketcher.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/iupac-drawing-sketcher.mdc)
- [STEREO_AND_ISOMERISM.md](STEREO_AND_ISOMERISM.md)
- [VALENCE_BONDS_AND_AROMATICITY.md](VALENCE_BONDS_AND_AROMATICITY.md)

## Tests and CI

```bash
# with venv active
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen   # Windows: $env:QT_QPA_PLATFORM="offscreen"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
python scripts/check_gpl_headers.py
python -m ruff check molmanager tests scripts
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on **Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows**: lint/header checks, pytest, Linux perf gate, and a dependency audit that **fails on CRITICAL/HIGH/malware** findings (see [dependency-audit-exceptions.md](dependency-audit-exceptions.md)).

## Dependency audit exceptions

Document ignored CVEs in [dependency-audit-exceptions.md](dependency-audit-exceptions.md) and list IDs in `docs/pip-audit-ignore.txt`.
