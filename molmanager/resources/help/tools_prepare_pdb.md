# Prepare PDB

Prepare PDB cleans and completes protein PDB files (heterogens, waters, missing atoms/hydrogens) ahead of docking setup.

## Goal

Produce a tidier receptor PDB suitable for PDBQT generation and docking.

## When to use

Use when raw PDB deposits need standard cleanup before Smina or other docking.

## Inputs / scope

An input PDB path on disk; writes an output PDB path. Not a table-row tool.

## Options

- **Input PDB** / **Output PDB** with **Browse...**.
- **Remove heterogens...**
- **Keep crystallographic waters**
- **Replace non-standard residues...**
- **Add missing heavy atoms...**
- **Add missing hydrogens at pH** + **pH**
- **Prepare PDB** / **Close**

## Workflow

1. Browse to the input PDB and set an output path.
2. Toggle cleanup options appropriate to your receptor.
3. Set hydrogen **pH** if adding hydrogens.
4. **Prepare PDB**, then continue to Prepare PDBQT.

## Use cases

- Clean a RCSB download before docking.
- Keep key waters in an active site.
- Add hydrogens at a chosen pH for protonation-sensitive pockets.

## Tips and limits

Automated fixes can mis-handle cofactors - inspect the site. This does not flex side chains for induced fit. Always visually check the binding pocket after prep.
