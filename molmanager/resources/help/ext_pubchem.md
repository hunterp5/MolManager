# PubChem

PubChem integration looks up compounds and runs similarity-oriented retrieval from PubChem into your workspace.

## Goal

Bring public structures and identifiers into the table for comparison with internal series.

## When to use

Use for quick public analogs, CID lookups, or expanding a query into PubChem neighbors.

## Inputs / scope

Needs network access to PubChem. Queries start from identifiers/SMILES/structures as the dialog requires.

## Options

- **Lookup / similarity search** - PubChem query modes in the dialog.
- **Query** - molecule or identifier fields.
- **Results** - preview list with **Add to table** actions.
- **Limits** - respect service rate/result caps shown in the UI.

## Workflow

1. Open **PubChem** from **External**.
2. Enter the query (ID or structure-based search as offered).
3. Review returned compounds.
4. Add useful rows to the main table and annotate source.

## Use cases

- Pull public analogs of a lead SMILES.
- Resolve a name/CID to a structure for the sketcher/table.
- Build a small reference set for FP similarity.

## Tips and limits

PubChem content is public and may include salts/mixtures - clean after import. Service availability and quotas apply. Similarity in PubChem is not identical to in-app FP settings.
