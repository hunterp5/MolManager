# Table

The compound table is the central grid of structures and properties: columns, sorting, context menus, numeric precision, and row selection drive almost every tool.

## Goal

Organize and inspect molecules so filters, plots, and models operate on the right columns and rows.

## When to use

Use continuously while analyzing; revisit this topic for sorting, column management, and selection behavior.

## Inputs / scope

All loaded rows and columns in the session. Structure columns supply depictions and chemistry; numeric/text columns supply plots and models.

## Options

- **Column headers** - sort and header context actions.
- **Row selection** - single or multi-select for scoped tools.
- **Context menus** - column/row operations and related actions.
- **Structure cells** - 2D depictions from the active render cache.
- **Precision / display** - numeric presentation controls where offered.

## Workflow

1. Load data and confirm structure columns render.
2. Sort or rearrange columns for the task.
3. Select rows or apply filters/search.
4. Launch tools that write new columns back into the table.

## Use cases

- Sort by score then select top-N for export.
- Keep descriptor columns beside assay columns for QSAR setup.
- Use precision controls before screenshots or reports.

## Tips and limits

Sorting does not by itself change chemistry - only order. Invalid molecules show empty/failed depictions and fail structure tools. Wide tables are easier if you hide unused columns when the UI allows.
