# Search

Search builds multi-criterion queries across columns with AND/OR logic, optional partial/case options, and SMARTS/substructure mode for structure columns.

## Goal

Find rows matching one or more textual or structural criteria quickly, then select or inspect the matches.

## When to use

Use for ad-hoc lookup (ID, name fragment, SMARTS) when a standing filter card is unnecessary.

## Inputs / scope

Searches the current table columns. Structure criteria need a valid structure/SMARTS-capable column.

## Options

- Criterion rows with **AND** / **OR** combinators.
- **Column** chooser and query field.
- **Partial match** and **Case Sensitive** options.
- **Substructure** / SMARTS mode for structure search.
- **Add** / remove (−) criteria rows.

## Workflow

1. Open **Search** and set the first column + query.
2. Add more criteria with **AND** or **OR** as required.
3. Enable **Substructure** when querying with SMARTS.
4. Jump to or select matches, then optionally promote logic into Filters.

## Use cases

- Find all rows whose ID contains a lot prefix.
- OR across synonym name columns.
- SMARTS-search a reactive motif before MMP analysis.

## Tips and limits

AND/OR mixes follow the criterion list order - keep queries simple when unsure. Invalid SMARTS yield no matches. Search is complementary to Filters; use Filters for persistent constraints.
