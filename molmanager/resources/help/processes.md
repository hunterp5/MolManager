# Processes

The Processes panel lists background jobs (descriptor calculation, clustering, exports, conformer builds, and similar) with status, cancel, and queue controls.

## Goal

Monitor, cancel, or clear queued work so heavy chemistry jobs do not block the UI and so you know when results are ready.

## When to use

Use whenever a tool starts a background worker, when the UI feels busy, or when you need to stop a long run before it finishes writing columns.

## Inputs / scope

Applies to jobs launched from the current session. Scope of each job (all rows vs selected) was chosen in the tool dialog that started it.

## Options

- Job list showing running and queued work.
- **Cancel** - stop the active or selected job when the worker supports cancellation.
- **Clear queue** - drop pending jobs that have not started yet.
- Status / progress text for the current operation.

## Workflow

1. Start a tool that runs asynchronously.
2. Open **Processes** to confirm the job appears and progresses.
3. **Cancel** if you launched the wrong scope or settings.
4. **Clear queue** to remove jobs waiting behind a long run.

## Use cases

- Stop a descriptor or conformer job that was applied to the full table by mistake.
- Clear a backlog of plot/export jobs after changing filters.
- Confirm a docking or enumeration job finished before exporting.

## Tips and limits

Not every step is instantly interruptible; cancel may finish the current chunk before stopping. Clearing the queue does not undo columns already written. Keep an eye on memory for very large libraries.
