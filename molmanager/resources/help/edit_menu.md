# Edit

The Edit menu covers undo/redo, clipboard operations, and selection commands that change table contents or the current selection set.

## Goal

Correct mistakes safely and move values or selections efficiently while editing the compound table.

## When to use

Use after accidental deletes/edits, when copying cells/structures, or when selecting all / inverting selection for scoped tools.

## Inputs / scope

Operates on the current table and selection. Undo depth depends on recent editable actions.

## Options

- **Undo** / **Redo** - reverse or reapply recent table edits.
- Clipboard commands (copy/paste as available).
- Selection commands (select all, clear, invert - per menu entries).
- Related edit actions exposed in the menu for the active table focus.

## Workflow

1. Make an edit or selection change.
2. Use **Undo** if the result is wrong.
3. Copy values as needed for external notes.
4. Shape selection before running **Selected Rows Only** tools.

## Use cases

- Undo a bulk column clear.
- Select all visible hits then invert to exclude them.
- Copy SMILES from selected cells into another app.

## Tips and limits

Not every background tool result is undoable the same way as cell edits - prefer session duplicates before destructive bulk jobs. Paste validity still depends on column types. Keep focus on the table for edit shortcuts to apply.
