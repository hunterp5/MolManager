# Generate Protomers

Generate Protomers enumerates protomers/tautomers from table rows or a SMILES string and can add chosen or all forms back into the table.

## Goal

Explore alternate ionization/tautomer forms explicitly as rows rather than a single dominant state.

## When to use

Use for tricky acidic/basic centers, tautomer-sensitive series, or when you want to dock or score multiple forms.

## Inputs / scope

**Input** mode is **Table rows** or **SMILES string**. Table mode uses **Source** and optional **Selected Rows Only**. **pH** influences approximate weights.

## Options

- **Input** - Table rows / SMILES string.
- **Source** - structure column for table mode.
- **Selected Rows Only** - scope table inputs.
- **pH** - target pH for population weighting.
- **Generate** - enumerate forms.
- **Add all to main table** / **Add selected to main table** - write results.

## Workflow

1. Choose input mode and structure source or SMILES.
2. Set **pH** and generate the ensemble.
3. Review enumerated structures.
4. Add all or selected forms to the main table.

## Use cases

- Enumerate forms of a kinase hinge binder tautomer pair.
- Expand a single SMILES into candidates for docking.
- QA protonation hypotheses before QSAR on charged sets.

## Tips and limits

Enumeration can multiply row counts quickly - filter afterward. Weights are approximate. pkasolver availability affects quality; treat outputs as candidates, not ground truth.
