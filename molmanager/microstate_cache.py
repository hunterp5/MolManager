"""Session in-memory cache of pkasolver microstates (structure key → picklable states).

Keyed by :func:`molmanager.workers.structure_grouping.structure_key` (canonical SMILES).
Used so Predict pKa and descriptor jobs (LogD/LogS 7.4, CNS MPO, …) share one GNN pass
per unique structure within the same app session. Cleared on Clear / shutdown.
Does not persist to SDF/CSV exports.
