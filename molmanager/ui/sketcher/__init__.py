Chemical sketcher UI split across ``constants``, ``bonds``, ``wildcards``, ``chem``, ``sketch_graph``,
``sketch_rdkit``, ``toolbar_glyphs``, ``widget``, and ``dialog``.

Public imports match the former ``MolManager.ui.sketcher`` module path.

**Stereochemistry:** single-bond wedge/hash encode tetrahedral configuration (narrow end = stereocenter).
Alkene **E/Z** is inferred from 2D geometry in ``alkene_stereo``. Tautomers, atropisomers, and arbitrary
diastereomer sets are not auto-enumerated; see ``docs/STEREO_AND_ISOMERISM.md``.

**IUPAC drawing:** hashed wedges, ring double-bond sidedness, condensed heteroatom labels, Clean Up
orientation, and interactive angle/length snap — see ``docs/IUPAC_DRAWING.md``.

**Bonds & valence:** internal bond ``order`` is 1–3 (single/double/triple); valence warnings sum incident
orders vs element/charge caps. Aromatic rings are Kekulized on load so doubles are preserved; see ``docs/VALENCE_BONDS_AND_AROMATICITY.md``.
